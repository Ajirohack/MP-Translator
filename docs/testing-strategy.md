# Testing Strategy for Translation App

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Real-Time Multi-Platform Translation App. The application integrates multiple services for Speech-to-Text (STT), Translation, and Text-to-Speech (TTS), requiring a comprehensive testing approach to ensure reliability and quality.

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, using mocks for dependencies.

Key areas for unit testing:

- Translation services (DeepL, GPT-4o, Google, Azure)
- STT services (Whisper, Google, Azure)
- TTS services (ElevenLabs, Azure, Google)
- Utility functions for language processing
- Quality assessment logic

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly.

Key integration test scenarios:

- STT → Translation pipeline
- Translation → TTS pipeline
- Complete end-to-end pipeline
- Service fallback mechanisms
- Context-aware translation

### 3. E2E Tests

End-to-end tests validate the application from a user perspective.

Key E2E test scenarios:

- Application startup and initialization
- UI interaction and settings configuration
- Real-time translation workflow
- Error handling and recovery

## Testing Tools

- **Mocha**: Test runner
- **Chai**: Assertion library
- **Sinon**: Mocking and stubbing
- **Nock**: HTTP request mocking
- **Playwright**: (future) Browser automation for E2E tests

## Mocking Strategy

Due to the reliance on external services and APIs, we employ extensive mocking:

1. **Service Mocks**: Mock implementations of translation services
2. **API Mocks**: Simulated API responses for external services
3. **Audio Mocks**: Generated audio data for testing STT and TTS

## Test Data

Test data is organized in:

- `tests/fixtures/test-data/`: Sample texts and translations
- `tests/fixtures/mock-responses/`: API response templates
- `tests/mocks/`: Mock implementations of services

## Test Coverage Targets

- Core translation services: 90%+
- Integration points: 80%+
- UI components: 70%+
- Error handling paths: 85%+

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Unit tests run on every PR and commit
2. Integration tests run on merge to main
3. E2E tests run before deployment

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **External Dependencies**: Solved with comprehensive mocking
2. **Audio Processing**: Use generated audio samples
3. **Performance Testing**: Dedicated stress tests for latency measurement

## Future Improvements

- Implement property-based testing for edge cases
- Add performance benchmarking to CI
- Improve test coverage for error conditions
- Expand browser compatibility testing
